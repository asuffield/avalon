This service stores the following data about you for an indefinite
period:

 - Your G+ userid number
 - Any actions you take during the game
 - Your apparent IP address, user agent string, the time of every
   request, and possibly your Google account name if appengine felt
   like logging it

It processes your real name on the client side, but that's mostly
handled by Google and is never sent to the server-side part of this
app.

This information is used to run the games and debug problems with the
software. That's all.

You're probably more interested in Google's privacy policy - they're
the ones processing your data for the hangout side. This app isn't
involved.
